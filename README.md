# Interpretable Deep Graph Koopman Operator
This is project is about learning Koopman Operator for Graphs in a data-driven way. Additionally, the Koopman eigenmodes
discovered by this method is interpretable.

## Do List
1. Implement basic [DeepKoopman](https://github.com/BethanyL/DeepKoopman) in PyTorch (original code in Tensorflow).
2. Add static and dynamic Koopman components from [Koopman Neural Forcaster](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/KNF).
3. Experiment with Human Connectome Project, IBIS, and, simulated Pendulum data.
